- Note(please read):  
   1. The api we chose is not stable. Sometimes it has access control and give
   status 403 when we access the server too frequently. Thus we set a timeout
   when we require the data. It is normal when you open the page and the page
   starts responding in a few seconds.  
   2. Sometimes the server will give status 500. This is not within our control and
   under this situation the page will not work temporarily.
   3. When server problems occur, please wait a few seconds and refresh the page.
   4: when you try to run our code. Please run "npm install" first to install all the dependencies.

Our application loads the rank of premier league 2017/18 and players of each team
in the premier league 2017/18 from the api we chose. We organize and display the data in a nice and clean way.

- Explain the end-user and how user will use it.  
This web application is designed for users who watch the Premier League, be
willing to check the newest league ranking and be interested in the detailed
